## Importing the pack
First, click the Minecraft Tab and look for the "Create a Custom Profile" button. If you look towards the top, you will see a link to instead "Import" a profile:

Clicking this button will prompt you to select a file. Navigate to the modpack zip file. This will automagically install that modpack as a new profile under the Minecraft tab. You don't have to set anything else up, it will install the modpack just as if you had used the Twitch App modpack browser to install it.
