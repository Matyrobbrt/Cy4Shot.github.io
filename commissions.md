<h1 id="Commissions">Commissions</h1>
Hello! I am now taking commissions for mods! I will create you a minecraft mod that you can use in your modpacks, or play with friends! I have plenty of experience in modding and have done many modding projects in the past. Note, I will only make mods for Forge 1.16+.

<h2 id="Reveiws">Reveiws</h2>
Here are some reveiws from happy customers :D
 - First time commissioning a mod, Cy4 did great! (SilverHatTrick, <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/siege-ladders-mod">Siege Ladders Mod</a>)

<h2 id="Pricing">Pricing</h2>
Unfortunately, this is not free D: The general pricing is listed below, but it is not final. I will discuss the pricing with you personally on discord. I will only send you the mod after you have paid, but you do not need to pay until I complete the mod.
 - Base Mod Price: $2
 - Basic Blocks and Items: $2
 - More advanced blocks / items: $1 each
 - Machine block with GUI: $2 each
 - Entity: $5 each
 - Any kind of minecraft code manipulation: $10
 - World Generation: $2 - $15
 - For pricing for features not listed here, DM me on discord.

<h2 id="Order">Order</h2>
In order to commission a mod, DM me on discord (Cy4Shot#0001). Once you have proposed your mod idea, I will discuss the pricing with you and then create the mod. Depending on the mod, it will take a variable amount of time for me to complete the commission, but once I do, I will show you the result, and send you the mod file after it has been paid for.

 - You may NOT claim commissioned mods as your own.
